# Books Store

This project is a bookstore administration tool implemented in vanilla JavaScript. It allows the user to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on a collection of books. In addition, the user can filter the list of books by price, rating, and name. The user can add new books to the inventory, edit existing entries, and remove books from the list. The application simulates the functionality of a real-world bookstore administrator.
