# Bookstore Administration Tool

This project is an application that allows users to manage a collection of books. It was implemented using **vanilla JavaScript** and includes features such as:

- **CRUD** (create, read, update, delete) operations on books
- Filtering books by **price**, **rating**, and **name**
- Adding new books to the **inventory**
- Editing existing book entries
- Removing books from the list

The application simulates the functionality of a **real-world bookstore administrator**, making it a useful tool for those in the book industry.
